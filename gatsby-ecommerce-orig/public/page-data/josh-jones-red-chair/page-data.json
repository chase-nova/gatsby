The Cigar rawhide sofa features a sturdy corner-blocked wooden frame and raw seams for that Malboro-person look. This brown leather sofa is cozy in a cottage, cabin, or a condo. And the leather (the leather!) becomes more beautiful with use: subtle character markings such as insect bites, healed scars, and grain variation reflects a real vintage. Saddle up and pass the remote.","currentInventory":17,"brand":"Jason Bourne"},"title":"Josh Jones Red Chair","type":"itemPage","next":{"id":"aa6db272-d5ac-47ec-91dc-aff248b5c14d","categories":["newarrivals","sofas"],"price":900,"name":"Thetis Gray Love Seat","image":"../downloads/fff1845f-6c4e-4138-8369-31e7d686e078couch7.png","description":"You know your dad’s incredible vintage bomber jacket? The Nirvana dakota tan leather sofa is that jacket, but in couch form. With super-plush down-filled cushions, a corner-blocked wooden frame, and a leather patina that only gets better with age, the Nirvana will have you looking cool and feeling peaceful every time you take a seat. Looks pretty great with a sheepskin throw, if we may say so. With use, this leather will become softer and more wrinkled and the cushions will take on a lived-in look, like your favorite leather jacket.","currentInventory":10,"brand":"Jason Bourne"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["409475740","409475740"]}
