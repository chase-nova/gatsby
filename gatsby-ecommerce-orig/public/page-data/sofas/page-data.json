The Nirvana dakota tan leather sofa is that jacket, but in couch form. With super-plush down-filled cushions, a corner-blocked wooden frame, and a leather patina that only gets better with age, the Nirvana will have you looking cool and feeling peaceful every time you take a seat. Looks pretty great with a sheepskin throw, if we may say so. With use, this leather will become softer and more wrinkled and the cushions will take on a lived-in look, like your favorite leather jacket.","currentInventory":10,"brand":"Jason Bourne"},{"id":"6a7a747f-afa4-48a5-94f0-5042040e50eb","categories":["newarrivals","sofas"],"price":800,"name":"Mod Leather Sofa","image":"../downloads/78752483-dabd-4855-8c8f-34ab90f734cdcouch6.png","description":"Easy to love. The Sven in birch ivory looks cozy and refined, like a sweater that a fancy lady wears on a coastal vacation.

Nestle it with plants, an ottoman, an accent chair, or 8 dogs.
